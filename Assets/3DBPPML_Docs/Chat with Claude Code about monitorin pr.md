Chat with Claude Code about monitorin processes

No, I cannot see other terminal windows. Here's what I can and cannot see:

**What I CAN see:**
- Output from commands I run using my terminal tool within our session
- Files in your workspace that I read explicitly
- Information you paste or share directly in our chat

**What I CANNOT see:**
- Other terminal windows you have open
- Background processes running in separate terminals
- Your screen or other applications
- Any terminal history from before our conversation

**Workarounds if you need me to monitor something:**

1. **Copy/paste the output** - You can paste relevant terminal output into our chat
2. **Log files** - If your process writes to a log file, I can read that file
3. **Run it through me** - I can run the command as a background process using my terminal tool, and then I'd be able to check on it

So if you have a training process or long-running task in another terminal and want me to see its progress, the easiest approach is either sharing the output with me or having the process write to a log file that I can read.
